# Paint
Microsoft Paint is dead, while there is no default Paint app for Mac. So I created an alternative simple paint application in Java with several tools and functions:
<br />
**Tools**: Pencil, Eraser, Sprayer, Filler, Line Creator (solid or dashed), Square/Rectangle Creator (hollow or filled), Circle/Oval Creator (hollow or filled), and Magnifer
<br />
**Functions**: Open/Save files, Undo/Redo, Copy/Cut/Paste, Select/Switch Colors, Select Brush Size/Type

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd Paint/classes`
3. `Java Main`

If it doesn't work, please try 
```
cd Paint/source
javac -d ../classes *.java
cd Paint/classes
Java Main
```
